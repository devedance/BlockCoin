## What is BlockCoin?
----------------

BlockCoin is an digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. BlockCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. BlockCoin Alpha Block-Code is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Alpha Block-Code software, see https://alphablockcode.org/en/download, or read the
